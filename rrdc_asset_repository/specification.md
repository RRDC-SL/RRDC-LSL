## Resource Depository Interface Specification ##

---------------------------------------------------

* Provide some kind of interface for the resource depository so people can get at the mods and such.
* Ideally should be able to add stuff to it without editing the script.

**Questions:**
* What's an example of the stuff being put in this depository?
* Does it need to have multiple sub-folders to make things easier to find?
* Does it need to be centralized with multiple frontend terminals?
* Is editing a notecard okay or does it need to work drag-n-drop?
