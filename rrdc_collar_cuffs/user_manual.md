# [SGD] RRDC Collar and Cuffs v1.1.2 "Bolvangar" - User Manual #

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Usage ##
Wear or add the collar and the 4 cuffs, then touch the collar to access the menu.

## Adding Your Character Sheet ##
1. Edit your collar and navigate to the Content tab of the edit window.
2. Drag your character sheet notecard into the object contents.
    * For best results, make sure your character sheet is the only notecard in the collar.

## Leash Handle Script Installation ##
1. Edit the object you want to act as a leash handle and select the prim you want to recieve chains.
2. Drag and drop the 'Leash Handle' script into the prim contents.

## LockGuard and Lockmeister ##
The collar and cuff set are fully capable of _both_ LockGuard and Lockmeister protocols.
* Additionally, LMV2 is supported. However, no third party LM extensions are supported.
* Don't change the descriptions of the objects, as this is where the ID is stored.
* Devices only capable of LMV1 will draw particles to the root prim of the cuffs/collar.

## Troubleshooting and Support ##

you can create an issue on the project GitHub page:
