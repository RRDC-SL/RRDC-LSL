Role lock access to certain features?
    (Wearer always has access?)
    Role query integrated with collar/badge on the avatar side (both send and receive?)
    In-world items like doors use a shared app channel, while avatars use an av channel ORed with the app channel.
        Role check query initiated usually by touch event, so avatar key is available to the script.
        Role check query sent on that avatar's specific app channel.
        If querying object is an attachment, reply sent on that avatar's channel, otherwise sent on shared app channel.
            Final step uses llRegionSayTo, and the requester will have saved the key of the avatar so to prevent cross-talk.
