## Notes for Distributors ##

1. You don't need to put the textures or sounds into the collar and cuffs if you don't want to
   distribute them that way, as the scripts use UUID references for everything but animations. 

2. If you wore the collar and cuffs for installation instead of rezzing, you will need to set
   root prim descriptions using 'Right click -> Properties' or it will reset when you detach them.

3. You can set whatever next owner permissions you would like on the scripts. However, please
   include the version number in the script names if you intend to distribute the scripts as
   'no-modify', so end users can properly fill out bug reports on github if necessary.

4. A copy of leash_handle.lsl should be included in the package distributed to end users. This
   allows for more creative freedom as it enables them to install a leash handle as part of their
   character's uniform. You can inactivate the script within the vendor object by opening it
   from the vendor's inventory and unchecking the 'Running' checkbox.

4. Please include a copy of user_manual.md as a notecard in the folder sent to end users. This
   file contains important information on usage and how to get support. If you made changes to
   the scripts before distribution, however, please modify user_manual.md to include your own 
   support information.
